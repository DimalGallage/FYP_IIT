Oh! great another meeting. Because who needs actual work when you can sit around and talk about it instead?
Wow your advice is just amazing. It's a good thing I didn't think of that myself after years of experience in this field.
Oh! sure let's just keep ignoring the elephant in the room. Because pretending everything is fine always works out so well.
You know what's really helpful? Being told what to do by someone who has absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
Congratulations on being the expert on a topic you just learned about five minutes ago. Your insight is truly invaluable.
Just finished a great workout! It feels so good to take care of my body and get moving.
Spent the day exploring a new city and trying new foods. 
Loving this book I'm reading right now. It's so captivating and I can't put it down.
Excited to spend the weekend with family and friends. There's nothing like good company and good conversation.
Grateful for the beautiful weather today. The sunshine and fresh air is just what I needed to boost my mood.
